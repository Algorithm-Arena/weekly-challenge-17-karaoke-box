# Weekly Challenge #17 - Karaoke Box

**For this challenge, you need to implement a karaoke visualization of a song where you display an indication of when the next set of lyrics is going to happen.** I love going to karaoke but one thing that drives me crazy is that I never know when to start singing the next set of lyrics and always end up off beat. For this challenge you'll want to find a creative way to help the singer.
